The codedoc plugin is directed at the display of large blocks of code.  Its basic syntax is:
<codedoc code> 
</codedoc>

<codedoc file> 
</codedoc>

<codedoc toggle description> 
</codedoc>

The first two create code blocks of the type specified by the parameter -- code or file.

The third creates an initially hidden code block which comes with a toggle button
enabling the block to be opened and closed (i.e.displayed and hidden).  The description,
which is a text string, describes the content of this block.

So, a more complete syntax model would be:
<codedoc code> 
 <codedoc toggle description> 
 </codedoc>
 <codedoc toggle description> 
 </codedoc>
</codedoc>

<codedoc file> 
 <codedoc toggle description> 
 </codedoc>
 <codedoc toggle description> 
 </codedoc>
</codedoc>

This nesting of the codedoc containers is limited to one level, that is you can't include a
toggle inside another toggle.

As of the present writing there are two forms for comment.  The first simply creates a timestamp
for the file which contains the documented code:

   ~~codedoc:timestamp~~

The second allows for internal comments on the code:
  ~~codedoc:comment~~             

The comment can contain Dokuwiki internal links, for instance:
  
   Dokuwiki embeds [[:snippet]] filenames in HTML definition lists [[:definitions#def_1|see definitions]]

As the above demonstrates, the links can contain references to internal link headings.  

If the comment contains a <br /> character, the comment will have the coment characters on
separate lines as in:

/*
  comment
**/

Otherwise the comment appears on one line:  /* comment */
